MSP.bs is a mail server log parser written in Bash. It's modeled after cPanel's excellent MSP.

Right now there's ready-ish support for Postfix and a WIP version for Exim that I'm too ashamed to share. It currently implements the two "main" features most people tend to use MSP for, checking sender stats and RBLs. Here's what it looks like:

```
[root@cwp ~]# MSP.bs --auth

MSP.bs was originally written because I needed something like MSP for CWP servers. This is probably the best code to ever run on a CWP server. CWP is horrible. Please do not use it. But feel free to use MSP.bs.
